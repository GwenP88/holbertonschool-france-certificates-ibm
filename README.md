# IBM Certification Project – Open Source & Agile Foundations

## Introduction

This repository gathers the IBM certificates completed during the Holberton School France program.

These certifications are an integral part of the curriculum and are designed to **complement the technical projects developed at Holberton**. They aim to strengthen both theoretical knowledge and professional skills that are essential in real-world software development environments.

Holberton requires students to complete these certifications in order to:
- Build a **strong foundation in industry standards and best practices**
- Gain exposure to **professional methodologies** used in modern tech teams
- Develop a broader understanding of the **software development lifecycle**
- Enhance students’ **employability and credibility** through recognized digital credentials
- Encourage autonomy, continuous learning, and adaptability

The topics covered by these certifications directly support the learning objectives of the Holberton program and prepare students for **internships, collaborative projects, and professional software teams**.

Each certificate stored in this repository reflects a validated learning milestone and demonstrates the student’s commitment to professional growth alongside technical training.
