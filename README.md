# IBM Certification Project – Open Source & Agile Foundations

## Introduction
This project is part of the Holberton France x IBM partnership, which grants students access to IBM’s online learning ecosystem through the **SkillsBuild** platform.  
The goal of this project is to introduce two key professional concepts used across modern software development teams: **Open Source Software** and **Agile Methodologies**.  
Through this project, I learned how to navigate IBM’s certification platforms, understand the governance and licensing of open source projects, and apply the fundamental principles of Agile workflows.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand the structure and governance of open source software.
- Learn how open source licenses work and why they are essential.
- Identify how to contribute to open source projects.
- Understand the foundations and values of Agile methodology.
- Discover Agile rituals, team dynamics, and project management practices.
- Obtain two IBM-recognized certifications and upload them following Holberton requirements.

## What I Learned
- The difference between **SkillsBuild** and **SkillsNetwork**, and how to create and use separate accounts for each platform.
- How open source projects operate, including governance models, contribution rules, documentation practices, and licensing.
- The key advantages and strategic benefits of open source within industry contexts.
- The fundamentals of Agile methodologies, including Scrum team roles, sprint planning, retrospectives, and incremental delivery.
- How to authenticate certificates in IBM Digital Credentials and link them to a professional profile.
- How to correctly upload certification files to GitHub with the proper naming, structure, and sharing requirements.

## Project Exercises & Certifications

### 1. Open Source Foundations Certificate  
**Objective**:  
- Understand the basics of open source software, licensing, governance, contribution workflows, and community engagement.

**Expected Output**:  
- IBM Open Source Software Certification  
- Upload the certificate image to the GitHub repository (correct folder + correct filename).  
- Provide the shareable credential link if available.

**Constraints**:  
- Must log in using the **@holbertonstudents.com** email.  
- Must log in on SkillsBuild and IBM Digital Credentials *before* accessing any course through tasks.

### 2. Agile Methodology Certificate  
**Objective**:  
- Learn the core concepts of Agile, Scrum roles, planning rituals, and team collaboration techniques.

**Expected Output**:  
- IBM Agile Methodology Certification  
- Upload the certificate image to the GitHub repository following project instructions.  
- Provide the shareable credential link if available.

**Constraints**:  
- Requires approximately one full day of work.  
- Certificate verification must be done by the student's SWE once uploaded.

## Platform & Access Requirements

### Required IBM Platforms
- **IBM Digital Credentials**  
- **IBM – SkillsBuild**

### Mandatory Guidelines
- Use the **Holberton student email** for all accounts and logins.  
- Your **first and last name must be correct** on all IBM platforms, as they appear on certifications.  
- Log in using **Log in with Email** *before* opening any course link from a task.  
- Upload certificates to GitHub in the correct folder with the correct naming convention.  
- Contact your SWE for scoring and manual review once each certificate is completed.

## Conclusion
This project provides the foundation for two essential areas of modern software engineering: **open source culture** and **agile teamwork**.  
The IBM certifications completed through this project not only validate technical understanding but also strengthen professional readiness, aligning with Holberton’s learning objectives and the RNCP expectations.  
Completing this project ensures the ability to correctly navigate IBM’s training ecosystem and sets the stage for more advanced certifications throughout the year.
